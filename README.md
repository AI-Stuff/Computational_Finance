# Computational Methods in Finance 
This repository contains projects focusing on investigating simulations and computational techniques applied in finance. Starting from the very basic random number generations, gradually move to more advanced option pricing topics. Major topics include Monte Carlo simulations, variance reductions, numerical methods and low discrepency series etc. 

1. Random Number Generations
2. Monte Carlo Simulations
3. Simulation of Stochastic Processes, discretization schemes 

(Ongoing)
